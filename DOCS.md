## Project setup and Gulp installation
You'll need to install Node and Gulp. Here's a walkthrough of how to get a project up and running.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html) and [Git](http://git-scm.com) on your machine. If you're a Windows user you'll also need to install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads).
2. [Install Gulp](http://Gulpjs.com/) using `npm install -g gulp`. You may need to use `sudo` in front of the Gulp install command to give it permissions.
3. Fork/Clone/Download the artreibp repository into your machine, you should hopefully see all the files and folders.
4. Open Terminal and install dependencies to `node_modules` directory in your project directory using `npm install`. You don't need `sudo` to do this.
5. The `npm install` you did in previous step should install all the dependencies, which you can confirm by visiting the `node_modules` in your project directory. Then use `gulp` (again in your project directory) to run the commands.
6. From now on, just run `gulp` in your project directory to automatically run Gulp tasks.
